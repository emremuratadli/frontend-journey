# Frontend Intern Notes

## NVM (Node Version Manager)
NVM allows developers to easily install, switch, and manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same machine.

### Why to Use NVM ?
* Allows switching between different Node.js versions (e.g., from v18.20.8 to v24.3.0)
* Enables using a specific Node.js version per project
* Ensures compatibility across team members and different environments

## NGINX
NGINX is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy. It helps with load balancing, caching, and hiding backend services to improve performance and security.

### Why to Use NGINX ?
* Requests go through NGINX, not directly to the backend. It improves security.

* Distributes traffic to multiple servers. It prevents crashes.

* Stores static or frequent responses. It speeds up delivery.

## Babel (Transpiler)
* Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible versions for older browsers.


## Webpack
* Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and bundles them into a single output file, optimizing the app for deployment.

## Microfrontend
* Microfrontend architecture breaks a frontend monolith into smaller, independently deployable units, each managed by different teams or technologies.
