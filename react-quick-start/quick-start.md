# Getting Started with React

## What is React?

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture makes it easy to create reusable and manageable UI elements, especially for single-page applications (SPA).

## Installing React

To start a React project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Then, you can create a new React project using the following commands:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

After these steps, you will have a running React application in your browser.

## Starting a Project

Inside your project folder, you can begin developing your application by creating your own components in the `src` directory. The main idea in React is to build each part of the UI as a separate component and combine them together.
