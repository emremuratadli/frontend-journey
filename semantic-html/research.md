# HTML5 Semantic Tags and Their Purpose of Use

## What Is Semantic HTML ?

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning and purpose of the content on a webpage. These tags make it easier not only for developers but also for browsers and search engines to understand the structure of the content. For example, we use `<header>` for the title of a page and `<article>` for the main content. This helps create a layout that is both readable and meaningful.

## Why is Semantic HTML Preferred ?

Semantic HTML is preferred because it makes the structure of the content clearer, improves accessibility, and helps search engines better understand the page. It provides more meaning than using generic tags like `<div>` or `<span>`.
