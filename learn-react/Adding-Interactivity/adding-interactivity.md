# Adding Interactivity

This section covers the fundamental principles of adding interactivity to the user interface in the React library. In modern web applications, interactivity is one of the most important elements that enriches user experience and reveals the dynamic nature of the application. Thanks to React's component-based architecture and declarative approach, managing user-triggered events and updating the UI can be handled systematically and sustainably. In this context, the technical foundations of interactivity and practical examples are examined. Key concepts:

**Event Handling**: In React, event handler functions are used to capture user interactions (clicks, typing, mouse movements, etc.). Event handlers can be defined directly in JSX and are triggered when the relevant event occurs. For example, handling a button click event:

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  }
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;
}
```

**State**: Holds the state of a component and reflects changes to the UI. When state is changed as a result of user interaction, React re-renders the relevant component and updates the UI. For example, managing the value entered in an input field with state:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function TextInput() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  return <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />;
}
```

## In-Depth Analysis

In React, interactivity begins with the proper management of events triggered by the user. Event handler functions allow the component's behavior to be changed dynamically. State plays a central role in managing these behaviors and changes in the UI. When state is updated, React's re-render mechanism is triggered, providing instant feedback to the user.

In complex applications, multiple event and state management strategies may be used. Sharing state between components is important for controlling data flow and ensuring application consistency.

## Summary

- User interactions are managed with event handlers.
- When state changes, the component is automatically re-rendered.
- Interactivity makes React applications dynamic and user-focused.
