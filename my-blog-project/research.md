# 1. HTML5 Semantic Tags and Their Purpose of Use

## What Is Semantic HTML ?

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning and purpose of the content on a webpage. These tags make it easier not only for developers but also for browsers and search engines to understand the structure of the content. For example, we use `<header>` for the title of a page and `<article>` for the main content. This helps create a layout that is both readable and meaningful.

## Why is Semantic HTML Preferred ?

Semantic HTML is preferred because it makes the structure of the content clearer, improves accessibility, and helps search engines better understand the page. It provides more meaning than using generic tags like `<div>` or `<span>`.

## Descriptions of Common HTML5 Semantic Tags

Tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<figure>`

`<header>` :

- **Definition:** Represents introductory content or a set of navigational links.
- **Purpose:** Typically contains site logos, titles, or menu bars.

`<nav>`:

- **Definition:** Defines a section that contains navigation links.
- **Purpose:** Used for site or page navigation menus.

`<section>`

- **Definition:** Represents a standalone section of content.
- **Purpose:** Groups related content together within a page.

`<article>`

- **Definition:** Represents independent, self-contained content.
- **Purpose:** Used for blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.

`<aside>`

- **Definition:** Holds extra content related to the main topic, like side notes or links.
- **Purpose:** Often used for sidebars, related links, or ads.

`<footer>`

- **Definition:** Represents the footer of a document or section.
- **Purpose:** Usually includes copyright info, contact details, or related links.

`<figure>`

- **Definition:** Represents self-contained content, typically with a caption.
- **Purpose:** Used for illustrations, diagrams, or photos along with `<figcaption>`.

# 2. CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and Responsive Design

## What is CSS and what is it used for ?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the appearance of HTML content. It controls visual aspects like color, font, size, and layout.

**Relation to HTML:**  
HTML provides the structure; CSS handles the presentation.

**Types of CSS:**
- **Inline:** Inside the HTML tag via the `style` attribute  
- **Internal:** Inside a `<style>` block within the HTML `<head>`  
- **External:** Linked as a separate `.css` file (e.g., `style.css`)

## What is the Box Model ?
The CSS Box Model explains how HTML elements occupy space and interact with the areas around them. Every element is treated as a rectangular box consisting of four main layers:

- **Content**: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.

- **Padding**: The space around the content. Background color is also visible in this area.

- **Border**: The line surrounding the padding. It can have different widths and styles.

- **Margin**: The space outside the border. It determines the distance between the element and others around it.

This structure helps control spacing, alignment, and visual layout of elements effectively.
