# Escape Hatches

This section provides a detailed overview of situations where it is necessary to go beyond React's standard declarative flow and the techniques used in those cases. In web applications, sometimes you need to bypass React's abstraction layers to directly manipulate the DOM or integrate with third-party libraries. These techniques, called escape hatches, increase React's flexibility and integration capabilities, giving developers more control over the application. In this context, the use of refs and imperative code practices are examined in detail. Key concepts:

**Ref**: In React, refs are used to directly access DOM elements. Refs are typically preferred in special cases such as integration with third-party libraries or focus management. Example usage of a ref:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Imperative Code**: When you need to go outside React's declarative structure, such as direct DOM manipulation or special operations, imperative code is written. This approach is commonly used in scenarios like animation, focus management, or integration.

## In-Depth Analysis

Escape hatches are used to gain more control over the application by going beyond React's abstraction layers. Ref and imperative code are typically used in special cases where React's standard data flow is not sufficient. These techniques increase the flexibility of the application and allow the developer to interact directly with the DOM.

## Summary

- Refs allow direct access to DOM elements.
- Imperative code enables special operations and integrations.
- Escape hatches increase React's flexibility and integration capabilities.
